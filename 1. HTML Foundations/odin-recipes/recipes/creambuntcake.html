    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>

      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped pecans</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a
        10-inch Bundt pan with cooking spray. Sprinkle chopped nuts evenly over
        the bottom of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine cake mix and pudding mix in a large bowl. Beat in eggs, Irish
        cream liqueur, oil, and water with an electric mixer on high speed for 5
        minutes. Pour batter over nuts in the prepared pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of
        cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cake cool in the pan for 10
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While cake is cooling, make glaze: Combine sugar, butter, and water in a
        small saucepan. Bring to a boil and continue boiling for 5 minutes,
        stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in Irish cream
      </li>
      <li>
        Invert cake onto a serving dish. Prick the top and sides of cake with a
        toothpick. Spoon glaze over the top and brush onto the sides. Allow cake
        to absorb glaze, then repeat until glaze is used up.
